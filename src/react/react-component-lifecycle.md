## Lifecycle Methods
https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/lifecycle-methods

In React, lifecycle methods are unique event listeners that listen for changes during certain points a component‘s lifecycle. A component’s lifecycle usually runs in this order:

- Rendering/mounting a component to the DOM for the first time.
- Updating an existing component.
- Catching any errors associated with a component render-gone-wrong.
- Unmounting a component and removing it from the DOM.
- Lifecycle methods were originally exclusive to class components. But thanks to React hooks, even functional components can work with their lifecycle.
