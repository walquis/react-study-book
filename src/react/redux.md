# Redux

Redux is a library for managing the state of complex React applications. It is separate from React and developed by a different team.

Redux is the most popular library and a viable alternative to Context API and a more advanced library with rich features. It can be a replacement for Context API. However, Context API does not have all the features of Redux.
