ES6 or ECMAScript 6 - scripting language spec, standardized by ECMAScript International.

This spec governs some languages such as JavaScript, ActionScript, and Jscript.

ECMAScript is generally used for client-side scripting; also used for writing server applications and services, using Node.js.

ES6 allows writing more readable code. With ES6 features, we write less and do more.

This tutorial introduces you to the implementation of ES6 in JavaScript.
